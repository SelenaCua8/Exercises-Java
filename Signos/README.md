## Exercises on Conditionals and Logical Operators

In this folder, I worked on several exercises to fully understand how conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and logical operators like `||` and `&&` work.

## Contents

### 1. `signos`
This file contains my first attempts using basic conditionals with `if` and `if-else`.  
I had some issues with the results because I got confused with the use of curly braces `{}`, which affected the flow of the program.

### 2. `signosParteDos`
This is a revised version of the previous exercise, using `else if` correctly.  
The structure is clearer, and the logic works as expected.

### 3. Folder `horoscopoChino`
In this folder, I used `else if` again, along with logical operators `||` and `&&` to handle multiple conditions.  
The logic works correctly, although I still need to add the images for each zodiac sign.

## Objective

This set of exercises is a full review of:

- Conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `else if`)
- Logical operators `||` (or) and `&&` (and)
- Proper code organization using curly braces `{}` and clear structure

With this, I complete my practice on conditionals and feel ready to move on to the next topic.

## How to Run (JAR File)

1. Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system. You can check by running:

2. Open a terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the directory where the `.jar` file is located.

3. Run the program with the following command:

Replace `nombreDelArchivo.jar` with the actual file name.

4. The application will run, and youâ€™ll see the output in the console or any GUI (if implemented).

> ğŸ’¡ You can also double-click the `.jar` file if your system has the default Java Runtime set correctly.
