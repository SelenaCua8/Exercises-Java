This is a fun Java-based game where the computer tries to **guess the character** you're thinking of based on your answers to three yes/no questions.

## How it works

1. You mentally choose one of the following Argentine personalities:
   - **A)** Lionel Messi  
   - **B)** Lilita CarriÃ³  
   - **C)** Sergio Massa  
   - **D)** Susana GimÃ©nez  
   - **E)** Domingo Faustino Sarmiento  

2. The program then asks you 3 questions:
   - Is your character alive?
   - Is your character male?
   - Is your character a politician?

3. Based on your answers, the program uses a **simple point-based system with `if`, `else if`, and counters** to guess who you're thinking of.

4. If it matches your character correctly, it will show a picture; otherwise, it apologizes for not getting it right.

## What you'll practice

- `if`, `else if`, `else` conditionals  
- Use of **counters** to track attributes  
- Working with **JOptionPane** dialogs for user interaction  
- Displaying images using **ImageIcon**

## Requirements

- JDK 8 or higher  
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)  
- The `/img` folder must be in the correct path with:
  - `messi.jpg`
  - `susanagimenez.png`
  - `sergiomassa.png`
  - `lilita-carrio.jpg`
  - `domingosarmiento.png`
  - `genio.png`
  - `logo.png`
